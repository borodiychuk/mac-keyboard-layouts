Latin and Cyrillic keyboards set
==================

This Mac keyboard layouts set for those who consider more than two layouts as hell.

Here we have Latin and Cyrillic keyboards. Latin is based on English and has keys that let you type in German and Slovak languages. Cyrillicis based on Ukrainian and it lets you type in Russian.

Place these bundles either into ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts``` or into ```~/Library/Keyboard Layouts```
